## The Task

For Project #1, we were tasked to work in a group to build a web application from scratch that solves a real-world problem.


## Description

To meet project requirements, our group created a web application called "Peak Fitness" that provides a tool for users to search bike trails and current weather conditions for a particular location. 

Peak Fitness uses a combination of HTML, Bulma CSS framework, JavaScript, and JQuery to render up-to-date data retrieved from two server-side APIs. Featured in our web application, we used OpenWeather API to display weather data and TrailAPI to display a list of trails.


## User Story

```
AS AN outdoor adventurer
I WANT to find my local biking trails and view the local weather forecast
SO THAT I can plan ahead before embarking on a biking trail
```


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am searching for biking trails
WHEN I enter a location and click the submit button
THEN I am presented with a list of trails and current weather conditions for that location
WHEN I select a location from the 'search history'
THEN I am presented with a list of trails and current weather conditions for the selected location
```
