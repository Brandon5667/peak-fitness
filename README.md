## Description

### *The Task*

For Project #1 of the *Coding Full Stack Boot Camp*, we were tasked to work in a group to build a web application from scratch that solves a real-world problem.

### *Our Project*

To meet project requirements, our group created a web application called "Peak Fitness" that provides a tool for users to search bike trails and current weather conditions for a particular location. 

Peak Fitness uses a combination of HTML, Bulma CSS framework, JavaScript, and JQuery to render up-to-date data retrieved from two server-side APIs and using client-side storage to store persistent data. Featured in our web application, we used OpenWeather API to display weather data and TrailAPI to display a list of trails.

```


## Acceptance Criteria
